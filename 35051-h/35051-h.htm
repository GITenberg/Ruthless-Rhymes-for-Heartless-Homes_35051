I &nbsp;  NEED no Comments of the Press,<br />
No critic's cursory caress,<br />
No paragraphs my book to bless<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With praise, or ban with curses,</span><br />
So long as You, for whom I write,<br />
Whose single notice I invite,<br />
Are still sufficiently polite<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To smile upon my verses.</span><br />
<br />
If You should seek for Ruthless Rhymes<br />
(In memory of Western climes),<br />
And, for the sake of olden times,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Obtain this new edition,</span><br />
You must not be surprised a bit,<br />
Nor even deem the act unfit,<br />
That I have dedicated it<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To You, without permission.</span><br />

And if You chance to ask me why,<br />
It is sufficient, I reply,<br />
That You are You, and I am I,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To put the matter briefly.</span><br />
That I should dedicate to You<br />
Can only interest us two;<br />
The fact remains, then, that I do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Because I want to&mdash;chiefly.</span><br />
<br />
And if these verses can beguile<br />
From those grey eyes of yours a smile,<br />
You will have made it well worth while<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To seek your approbation;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">No further meed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of praise they need,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But must succeed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And do indeed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">If they but lead</span><br />

<h2>Author's Preface</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
WITH guilty, conscience-stricken tears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I offer up these rhymes of mine</span><br />
To children of maturer years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(From Seventeen to Ninety-nine).</span><br />
A special solace may they be<br />
In days of second infancy.<br />
<br />
The frenzied mother who observes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This volume in her offspring's hand,</span><br />
And trembles for the darling's nerves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must please to clearly understand,</span><br />
If baby suffers by-and-bye<br />
The Artist is to blame, not <i>I!</i><br />
<br />
But should the little brat survive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fatten on the Ruthless Rhyme,</span><br />
To raise a Heartless Home and thrive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through a successful life of crime,</span><br />
The Artist hopes that you will see<br />
That <i>I</i> am to be thanked, not <i>he!</i><br />
</div></div>

Fond parent, you whose children are<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of tender age (from two to eight),</span><br />
Pray keep this little volume far<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From reach of such, and relegate</span><br />
My verses to an upper shelf,&mdash;<br />
Where you may study them yourself.<br /><br /><br />

So, that night, inside her bed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Placed some nettles and a thistle.</span><br />
<br />
Though dear grandma quite infirm is,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heartless Hannah watched her settle,</span><br />
With her poor old epidermis<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Resting up against a nettle.</span><br />

Suddenly she reached the thistle!<br />
My! you should have heard her whistle!<br />

<h2>John</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
JOHN, across the broad Atlantic,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tried to navigate a barque,</span><br />
But he met an unromantic<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And extremely hungry shark.</span><br />
<br />
John (I blame his childhood's teachers)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thought to treat this as a lark,</span><br />
Ignorant of how these creatures<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do delight to bite a barque.</span><br />
<br />
Said "This animal's a bore!" and,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a scornful sort of grin,</span><br />
Handled an adjacent oar and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Chucked it underneath the chin.</span><br />
<br />
At this unexpected juncture<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which he had not reckoned on,</span><br />
Mr. Shark he made a puncture<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the barque&mdash;and then in John.</span><br />
<br />
Sad am I, and sore at thinking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">John had on some clothes of mine;</span><br />
I can almost see them shrinking,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Washed repeatedly in brine.</span><br />
<br />
I shall never cease regretting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I lent my hat to him,</span><br />
For I fear a thorough wetting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cannot well improve the brim.</span><br />
<br />
Oh! to know a shark is browsing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Boldly, blandly on my boots!</span><br />
Coldly, cruelly carousing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the choicest of my suits!</span><br />
<br />
Creatures I regard with loathing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who can calmly take their fill</span><br />
Of one's J&aelig;ger underclothing:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down, my aching heart, be still!</span><br />

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
ALL those who see my children say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What sweet, what kind, what charming elves!"</span><br />
They are so thoughtful, too, for they<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are <i>always</i> thinking of themselves.</span><br />
It must be ages since I ceased<br />
To wonder which I liked the least.<br />
<br />
Such is their generosity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That, when the roof began to fall,</span><br />
They would not share the risk with me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But said, "No, father, take it all!"</span><br />
Yet I should love them more, I know,<br />
If I did not dislike them so.<br /><br /><br />

<h2>"Bluebeard"</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
YES, I am Bluebeard, and my name<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is one that children cannot stand;</span><br />
Yet once I used to be so tame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd eat out of a person's hand;</span><br />
So gentle was I wont to be<br />
A Curate might have played with me.<br />
<br />
People accord me little praise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet I am not the least alarming;</span><br />
I can recall, in bygone days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A maid once said she thought me charming.</span><br />
She was my friend,&mdash;no more I vow,&mdash;<br />
And&mdash;she's in an asylum now.<br />
<br />
Girls used to clamour for my hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Girls I refused in simple dozens;</span><br />
I said I'd be their brother, and<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">They promised they would be my cousins.</span><br />
(One, I accepted,&mdash;more or less&mdash;<br />
But I've forgotten her address.)<br />
<br />
They worried me like anything<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By their proposals ev'ry day,</span><br />
Until at last I had to ring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bell, and have them cleared away;</span><br />
(I often pondered on the cost<br />
Of getting them completely lost.)<br />
<br />
To share my somewhat lofty rank<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was what they panted for, like mad;</span><br />
You see my balance at the bank<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was not so small, and, I may add,</span><br />
A Castle, Gothic and immense,<br />
Is my Official Residence.<br />
<br />
It overlooks a many a mile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of park, of gardens and domains;</span><br />
I'm staying now in lodgings, while<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">They're doing up the&mdash;well&mdash;the drains,&mdash;</span><br />
For they began to give offence<br />
At my Official Residence.<br />
<br />
And, when I entertain at home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I hardly ever fail to please,</span><br />
The "upper tens" alone may come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To join in my "recherch&eacute;" teas;</span><br />
I am a King in ev'ry sense<br />
At my Official Residence.<br />
<br />
My dances, on a parquet floor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My royal dinners, which consist</span><br />
Of fifteen courses, sometimes more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are things that are not lightly missed;</span><br />
In fact I do not spare expense<br />
At my Official Residence.<br />
<br />
My hospitality to those<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whom I invite to come and stay</span><br />
Is famed; my wine like water flows,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Exactly like, some people say,</span><br />
But this is mere impertinence<br />
At my Official Residence.<br />
<br />
When through the streets I walk about<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My subjects stand and kiss their hands,</span><br />
Raise a refined metallic shout,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wave flags and warble tunes on bands,</span><br />
While bunting hangs on ev'ry front,&mdash;<br />
With my commands to let it bunt.<br />
<br />
When I come home again, of course,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Retainers are employed to cheer,</span><br />
My paid domestics get quite hoarse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Acclaiming me, and you can hear</span><br />
The welkin ringing to the sky,&mdash;<br />
Aye, aye, and let it welk, say I!<br />
<br />
And yet, in spite of this, there are<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some persons who, at diff'rent times,</span><br />
&mdash;(Because I am so popular)&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Accuse me of most awful crimes;</span><br />
A girl once said I was a flirt!<br />
Oh my! how the expression hurt!<br />
<br />
I <i>never</i> flirted in the least,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never for very long, I mean,&mdash;</span><br />
Ask any lady (now deceased)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who partner of my life has been;&mdash;</span><br />
Oh well, of course, sometimes, perhaps,<br />
I meet a girl, like other chaps.<br />
<br />
And, if I like her very much,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And if she cares for me a bit,</span><br />
Where is the harm of look or touch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If neither of us mentions it?</span><br />
It isn't right, I don't suppose,<br />
But no one's hurt if no one knows!<br />
<br />
And, if I placed my hand below<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her chin and raised her face an inch,</span><br />
And then proceeded&mdash;well, you know,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Excuse the vulgarism)&mdash;to clinch;</span><br />
It would be wrong without a doubt,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>That is, if anyone found out.<br />
<br />
But then, remember, Life is short<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Woman's Arts are very long,</span><br />
And sometimes when one didn't ought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One knowingly commits a wrong;</span><br />
Well&mdash;speaking for myself, of course,<br />
I almost always feel remorse.<br />
<br />
One should not break one's self <i>too</i> fast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of little habits of this sort,</span><br />
Which may be definitely classed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With gambling or a taste for port;</span><br />
They should be <i>slowly</i> dropped, until<br />
The Heart is subject to the Will.<br />
<br />
I knew a man on Seventh Street<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who, at a very slight expense,</span><br />
By persevering, was complete-<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ly cured of total abstinence;</span><br />
An altered life he has begun<br />
And takes a horn with anyone.<br />
<br />
I knew another man whose wife<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was an invet'rate suicide,</span><br />
She daily strove to take her life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And (naturally) nearly died;</span><br />
But some such system she essayed,<br />
And now she's eighty in the shade.<br />
<br />
Ah, the new leaves I try to turn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, like so many men in town,</span><br />
I seem, as with regret I learn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Merely to turn the corner down;</span><br />
A habit which I fear, alack!<br />
Makes it more easy to turn back.<br />
<br />
I have been criticised a lot;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I venture to enquire what for;</span><br />
Because, forsooth, I have not got<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The instincts of a bachelor!</span><br />
Just hear my story, you will find<br />
How grossly I have been maligned.<br />
<br />
I was unlucky with my wives,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So are the most of married men;</span><br />
Undoubtedly they lost their lives,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of course, but even so, what then?</span><br />
I loved them dearly, understand,<br />
And I <i>can</i> love, to beat the band.<br />
<br />
My first was little Emmeline,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More beautiful than day was she;</span><br />
Her proud, aristocratic mien<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was what at once attracted me.</span><br />
I naturally did not know<br />
That I should soon dislike her so.<br />
<br />
But there it was! And you'll infer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I had not very long to wait</span><br />
Before my red-hot love for her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turned to unutterable hate.</span><br />
So, when this state of things I found,<br />
I naturally had her drowned.<br />
<br />
My next was Sarah, sweet but shy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And quite inordinately meek;</span><br />
Yes, even now I wonder why<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I had her hanged within the week.</span><br />
Perhaps I felt a bit upset,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>Or else she bored me, I forget.<br />
<br />
Then came Evangeline, my third,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, when I chanced to be away,</span><br />
She, so I subsequently heard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was wont (I deeply grieve to say)</span><br />
With my small retinue to flirt.<br />
I strangled her. I hope it hurt.<br />
<br />
Isabel was, I think, my next,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(That is, if I remember right)&mdash;</span><br />
And I was really very vexed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To find her hair come off at night;</span><br />
To falsehood I could not connive,<br />
And so I had her boiled alive.<br />
<br />
Then came Sophia, I believe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her coiffure was at least her own,</span><br />
Alas! she fancied to deceive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her friends by altering its tone.</span><br />
She dyed her locks a flaming red!<br />
I suffocated her in bed.<br />
<br />
Susannah Maud was number six;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But she did not survive a day;</span><br />
Poor Sue, she had no parlour tricks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hardly anything to say.</span><br />
A little strychnine in her tea<br />
Finished her off, and I was free.<br />
<br />
Yet I did not despair, and soon!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In spite of failures, started off</span><br />
Upon my seventh honeymoon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With Jane; but could not stand her cough.</span><br />
'Twas chronic. Kindness was in vain.<br />
I pushed her underneath the train.<br />
<br />
Well, after her, I married Kate.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A most unpleasant woman. Oh!</span><br />
I caught her at the garden gate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kissing a man I didn't know;</span><br />
And, as that didn't suit me quite,<br />
I blew her up with dynamite.<br />
<br />
Most married men, so sorely tried<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As this, would have been rather bored.</span><br />
Not I, but chose another bride<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And married Ruth. Alas! she snored!</span><br />
I served her just the same as Kate,<br />
And so she joined the other eight.<br />
<br />
My last was Grace; I am not clear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I <i>think</i> she didn't like me much;</span><br />
She used to scream when I came near,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shuddered at my lightest touch.</span><br />
She seemed to wish to keep aloof,<br />
And so I threw her off the roof.<br />
<br />
This is the point I wish to make:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From all the wives for whom I grieve,</span><br />
Whose lives I had perforce to take,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not one complaint did I receive;</span><br />
And no expense was spared to please<br />
My spouses at their obsequies.<br />
<br />
My habits, I would have you know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are perfect, as they've always been;</span><br />
You ask if I am good, and go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To church, and keep my fingers clean?</span><br />
I do, I mean to say I am,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>I have the morals of a lamb.<br />
<br />
In my domains there is no sin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Virtue is rampant all the time,</span><br />
Since I so thoughtfully brought in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A bill which legalizes crime;</span><br />
Committing things that are not wrong<br />
Must pall before so very long.<br />
<br />
And if what you imagine vice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is not considered so at all,</span><br />
Crime doesn't seem the least bit nice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's no temptation then to fall;</span><br />
For half the charm of things we do<br />
Is knowing that we oughtn't to.<br />
<br />
Believe me, then, I am not bad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though in my youth I had to trek</span><br />
Because I happened to have had<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some difficulties with a cheque.</span><br />
What forgery in some might be<br />
Is absentmindedness in me!<br />
<br />
I know that I was much abused,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">No doubt when I was young and rash,</span><br />
But I should not have been accused<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of misappropriating cash.</span><br />
I may have sneaked a silver dish;&mdash;<br />
Well, you may search me if you wish!<br />
<br />
So, now you see me, more or less,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As I would figure in your thoughts;</span><br />
A trifle given to excess<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And prone perhaps to vice of sorts;</span><br />
When tempted, rather apt to fall,<br />
But still&mdash;a good chap after all!<br /><br /><br />

Produced by Mark C. Orton and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This book was
produced from scanned images of public domain material
from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
